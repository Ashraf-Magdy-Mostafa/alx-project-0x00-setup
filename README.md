# 🏡 ALX Airbnb Clone – React Genesis (Next.js Setup)

This project is part of the **ALX ProDev Frontend track**, focused on building the foundational structure of a modern React web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It mimics key UI features of Airbnb, such as property listings, image cards, ratings, and reusable components, while emphasizing scalable architecture and clean development practices.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this project is to introduce developers to the core concepts of setting up and structuring a Next.js project from scratch. You will learn how to scaffold a React app, organize components, implement routing, and use TypeScript for strong typing. The project walks through building a responsive UI with reusable and modular components.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Next.js v13+** – React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for component safety
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **ESLint** – Linting and code formatting tool
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment (v16+)
- **npm** – Package manager for dependencies
